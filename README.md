# TextAnalyzer

This program analyzes the text entered by the user, calculating the number of sentences, words, and different types of sentences (narrative, interrogative, exclamation). It also determines the number of spelling errors with suggestions for correcting them, counts the total number of characters and punctuation marks, and determines the style of the text. The program includes four windows: the start window, the main window, information about the author and about the program.
